RAM - bytes.

Location in memory.  Needed to put the null bytes into the locations as well. 

\0 is to store NULL.

A sequence is an array or [].

If we want to terminate, in initals. We need the fourth byte to terminate string.

Iterate with a for loop over the characters of the names.

Insertion sort.  <Inserting letters or number in their appropriate location.>

Sorting values. 

Bubble Sorting. <Switching based on order>

Selection Sort. <Sort based on min to location>

Size of the problem.

Running time.

Bubble Sort.  We compared each set of numbers and sorted based numbers. n^2/2 - n/2.
    1,000,000.  Can remove n/2.  O(n^2).

BigO is the maximum steps needed.

O(n^2)
O(n log n)
O(n)
O(logn)
O(1)

Merge Sort. <Sort left half, sort right half, merge the remainder.>

In c you get to choose the names of your inputs for a function, it does not have to be the same one you passed in
    when calling the function.

Recursion.  The act of a function calling itself.

Sum 0-m

m + Sum of everything < m.

Handing back only part of the problem. If m = 0, the function is not called.

Use recursion rather than a for loop to call a function.

Merge Sort [4 2 7 5 6 8 3 1] -> [4 2 7 5][6 8 3 1] -> [4 2][7 5][4 2][7 5] -> [4][2]
    [2 4][5 7][6 8][1 3] -> [2 4 5 7][1 3 6 8] -> [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8]

Merge sort is fundamentally faster because we are dividing the program in half.

log<2> of 8 is 3.
