Field of computer science is about solving problems.

Inputs and ___ and outputs.

Algorithims is the empty box.

Speak binary.  once you have two digits in your alphabet you can cross in more information. Uses the hand definition. 

Mental models for columns. 100 + 20 + 3 = 123

2n is binary.

0 0 1 is 1
0 1 0 is 2
0 1 1 is 3

Electricity was the first thing important. 

Transitors represent this binary.

ASCII - Pattern of bits to store information.  For example 65 - A.

72 - H
73 - I
33 - !

UNICODE came after ASCII.

RGB - Combines to form all colors.

byte = 8 bits.

byte can numbers, alphabet, symbols, colors.

It is important to understand the lower level.

Algorithim. Step by step instructions for solving a problem.

Peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  Computers will only do what you tell them to do exactly.
    example was the professor making a pbnj.

Problems need to be broken up into their parts.

Phonebook example of algorithims.
1. Go through page by page.
2. Go through 2 pages at a time and backtrack 1.
3. Splitting in half each time.

Time to Solve versus Size of Problem
n, n/2, log(n).

log(n) can handles doubling of input size very well.

Recursion. Doing the same thing but making the problem smaller.

Scratch is the first programmming language we are going to use in the first week.
