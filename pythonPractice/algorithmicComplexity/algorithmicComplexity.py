'''to track time in python, use the following commands:

import time
start_time = time.time()
print ("---%s seconds ---" % (time.time() - start_time))


'''
import time
start_time = time.time()

a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

print (a)
print ("---%s seconds ---" % (time.time() - start_time))

'''you can also measure time directly in the cmd prompt

use $Measure-Command {command}

note: powershell needs to be instaled for this to work.
