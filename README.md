# Studying
All of the information from my studying.

Background: I am a fully self-taught developer.  I have used some online courses (i.e. freeCodeCamp) to learn languages to this point.  
I am starting with approximately 800 hours of coding experience.  This would be approximately 20 weeks, or 5 months, of programming experience in 40-hour a week job.
Here is the breakdown by language:
-Python 400 hours (general lanaguage, )
-HTML 200 hours (HTML5)
-CSS 100 hours (and SASS)
-JavaScript 100 hours (react)

During this project, I will be using skills I have developed as a professional in project management (5-years), operations management (6-years), and organization development (5-years).
I plan on attending networking events throughout this process where I live (Fargo, ND) and try and develop an online network.

Each day (7 days per week) I will contribute 2-4 hours towards learning or accomplishing my goal.
Each day I will journal in this readMe my accomplishments and what I put my time towards.


December 14 (4-hours) - I started out reading information about becoming a software engineer.  I spent about 1-hour learning gitHub and how to push/pull/commit/add files from the command prompt to a repository.  I plan on using gitHub throughout this process.


December 15 - The goal of this is to spend the next 12 months working towards becoming a software engineer in conjunction with finishing my PhD. I live next to a Microsoft and John Deere and SunDog Headquarters and my goal is to be hired by one of them.

To accomplish this goal, I am following the outline provided by coding-interview-university.
This can be found here: https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university
Following this outline, I am setting out to learn four different programming languages: c, c++, c#, and python.
Originally I had planned on only learning Python, but I believe learning several languages in conjunction will give me a better understanding of being a programmer as a whole.
