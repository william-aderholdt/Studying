# Studying
All of the information from my studying.

Background: I am a fully self-taught developer.  I have used some online courses (i.e. freeCodeCamp) to learn languages to this point.  
I am starting with approximately 800 hours of coding experience.  This would be approximately 20 weeks, or 5 months, of programming experience in 40-hour a week job.
Here is the breakdown by language:
-Python 400 hours (general lanaguage, )
-HTML 200 hours (HTML5)
-CSS 100 hours (and SASS)
-JavaScript 100 hours (react)

In addition to learning languages, I also spent some time learning other subjects prior to this. My primary time as spent in machine learning and data analytics, which will be reflected in the timeTracker.  Data analytics is specific to the time I have spent learning via Python, I have several hundred hours working with data as a part of my PhD program.

During this project, I will be using skills I have developed as a professional in project management (5-years), operations management (6-years), and organization development (5-years).
I plan on attending networking events throughout this process where I live (Fargo, ND) and try and develop an online network.

Each day (7 days per week) I will contribute 2-4 hours towards learning or accomplishing my goal.
Each day I will journal in this readMe my accomplishments and what I put my time towards.

I will be spending time on Hacker Rank working through problems.
I will also be spending time on projects which I will add to my gitHub and describe here.

See dayJournal for a summary of what was accomplished each day.
See videosWatched to see what was watched and from what source.
See timeTracker to see where time was spent each day.

The goal of this is to spend the next 12 months working towards becoming a software engineer in conjunction with finishing my PhD. I live next to a Microsoft and John Deere and SunDog Headquarters and my goal is to be hired by one of them.
To accomplish this goal, I am following the outline provided by coding-interview-university.
This can be found here: https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university
Following this outline, I am setting out to learn four different programming languages: c, c++, c#, and python.
Originally I had planned on only learning Python, but I believe learning several languages in conjunction will give me a better understanding of being a programmer as a whole.
